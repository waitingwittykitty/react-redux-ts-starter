# cra-redux-ts

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

typescripts and vscode setup based on article [Setting up your create-react-app project with TypeScript & VSCode](https://medium.com/@xfor/setting-up-your-create-react-app-project-with-typescript-vscode-d83a3728b45e) by Micha≈Ç Wrzosek.

redux-toolkit implemented with close reference to github project [React Redux Toolkit Typescript](https://github.com/darylwalsh/redux-toolkit-example-ts)

This project also follows the ideas in the redux-toolkit advanced documentation : [Advanced Tutorial: Redux Toolkit in Practice](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/tutorials/advanced-tutorial)

This project uses hooks and functional components exclusively.

This project uses typescript, both for typing and for advanced features that can be downcompiled.

This project uses eslint, with some plugins to make it work better with typescript.

This project uses npm instead of yarn by default.

This project is set to format on save with prettier in vscode. I like this setting, please give it a try.
